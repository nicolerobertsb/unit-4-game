# unit-4-game
A fun and interactive game for web browsers. The app dynamically updates the HTML pages with the jQuery library.


Basic Information
There are 4 crystals that will be displayed as buttons.
A player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When a crystal is clicked, the player's score counter will update.
The player wins if the total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
